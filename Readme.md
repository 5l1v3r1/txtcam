Installation
----

    git clone https://github.com/dhotson/txtcam.git
    cd txtcam
    make
    ./txtcam


Note: You will probably need Xcode for this to work.
[Let me know](mailto:dennis.hotson@gmail.com) if you run into problems or need any help getting setup.

To do
----

It'd be great to make this work basically like skype for your terminal.

- Network client and server
- Audio
- 24-bit "true color" support (iTerm2 nightlies [currently support 24-bit color](https://code.google.com/p/iterm2/issues/detail?id=218), hopefully in a stable release very soon)
- Preserve aspect ratio
